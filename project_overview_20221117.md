# Overview 

Project WP2 started Feb 22

End of project: 2025 Sep 30



## WP1 Compiling the environemtal food database in Nor-Eden

 DB with environmental impact 

KBS (calculation infrastructure) energy, nutrients, ingredients... 4000 foods 

- greenhouse gas emission
- terrestrial acidification (change of soil acidity)
- land use
- marine and fresh water eutrophication
- water use 

compile published data 

system boundary

environmental db (RIVM, Agri-footprint, Ecolnvent)

Poor and nemecek, revised for Norwegian context

Imported food (e.g. apples), compute average for a few countries 

try to discover difference between Norwegian food and imported food





## Sustainable healthy diets for young children in Norway

Ellen Cecilie Andresen (PhD studnet, UiO)

environmental impact of infant formula vs breastfeeding

Recommendation: 4-6m exclusive breastfeeding, then gradual introduction to family foods

Breastfeeding: healthy, socially and culturally acceptable, affordable (to not work), but environmental? 

LCA methodology 

assess environmental impact of

- production and distribution to retial in Norway, of powdered infant formula 
- preparation of infant formula, and consumption (including bottle production, sterilisation)
- compare with breastfeeding

impact factors (as above)

feeding with formula results in 35% - 72% higher environmental impact than breastfeeding 

milk producttion is the most important process (vs preparation and consumption)
