# Motivation 

### Important and relevant question

climate impact of food production

- food production has a large env impact 

- greenhouse emissions: food is responsible for 1/4 of the world's emissions, raise temperature by 2 degrees this century

  - Livestock (e.g. cattle), fisheries
  - crop 
  - land use (e.g. savannah burning)
  - supply chains (e.g. food processing, distribution, transport, ...) 

- water eutrophication 78%

- freshwater withdrawal 70%

  

what we eat matters more than how it has travelled

- transport accounts for 5% of food system emissions
- internationally traded food travels by boat, not by plane 



differences in carbon footprint

- Meat and dairy foods have more carbon footprint 
- same foods have large variance (e.g. 100g beef emits 25kg co2-eq, but range between 9 to 105 kg )
